# Project Odin - Odin Recipes
This project has a sole purpose of displaying foundational HTML ability.

There is an index page, and three hyperlinked pages with recepies. Each recepy contains a title, image, description, ingredients, and steps. 

On this project I used:
1. Basic HTML formatting.  
1. Ordered and unordered lists
1. Image tag(img)  
1. Hyperlinks
